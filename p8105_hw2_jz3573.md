# Quesioin 2

## tidy up Mr.Trash Wheel

``` r
Mr=
  read_excel("./data/Trash.xlsx", 1,range="A2:N586") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(dumpster_number=dumpster) %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster_number) %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons *500/30,
         trash_wheel="Mr")
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `Year` -> `Year...3`
    ## • `Year` -> `Year...4`

## Tidy up Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
Pro=
  read_excel("./data/Trash.xlsx", 2,range="A2:M108") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(dumpster_number=dumpster) %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster_number) %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons *500/30,
         trash_wheel="Professor")
```

## Tidy up Gwynnda

``` r
Gwy=
  read_excel("./data/Trash.xlsx", 3 ,range="A2:L157") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(dumpster_number=dumpster) %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster_number) %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered= weight_tons *500/30,
          trash_wheel="Gwynnda") 
```

## Merge the three datasets

``` r
joint=
     full_join(Gwy, Pro) |>
     full_join(x = _, y = Mr)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(dumpster_number, month, year, date, weight_tons,
    ## volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
    ## plastic_bags, wrappers, homes_powered, trash_wheel)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(dumpster_number, month, weight_tons,
    ## volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
    ## plastic_bags, wrappers, homes_powered, trash_wheel, glass_bottles)`

## Descriptiion of the dataset:

The dataset contains 718 observations and 17 variables.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26

The dataset describe the detail of drumpsters, which include the
drumpsters’ number, the weight of trash and the type of trash.

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
is 3200

# Question 3

## Tidy baseline df

Following codes ensure that sex and APOE4 carrier status are appropriate
encoded and every participant meet the stated inclusion criteria
(i.e. no MCI at baseline).

``` r
baseline=
  read.csv("./data/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
      sex =case_match(sex,
                      0 ~ "female",
                      1 ~ "male"),
      apoe4=case_match(apoe4,
                      1 ~ "carrier",
                      0 ~ "non-carrier")) %>% 
     filter( age_at_onset=="." | age_at_onset>  current_age)
```

## Tidy up the longitudinal dataset:

Following codes tidy up the variables’ names and transfer the dataframe
into a machine-friendly frame.

``` r
amyloid=
  read.csv("./data/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename ("id"="study_id") %>% 
  pivot_longer( 
    cols=baseline:time_8, 
    names_to = "time", 
    values_to = "amyloid_ratio") 
```

## Descripe the longitudinal dataframe:

The dataset contains 2435 observations and 3 variables. There are
`r`n_distinct((pull(amyloid,id)))\` participants in this dataset. MCI is
recorded at baseline, time 2, time 4, time 6, and time 8. There are a
lot of missing values, meaning that many participants missed visits.

## Merge the datasets and its descriptions

The two datasets were joined by the common variable: id. Only those
participants who are enrolled in both datasets are shown in the full_df.

``` r
full_df = 
  inner_join(baseline, amyloid, by = c("id"))
```

The dataset contains 2355 observations and 8 variables.There are 471
participants in the dataframe.

8participants appear in only the baseline datasets. 16participants
appear in only the amyloid datasets.

## Export the dataset as a csv

``` r
write.csv(full_df, "./data/baseline_amyloid_merged.csv")
```
